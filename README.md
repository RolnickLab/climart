## Official PyTorch Implementation

### Using deep learning to optimise radiative transfer calculations.

Abstract:   *Numerical simulations of Earth's weather and climate require substantial amounts of computation. This has led to a growing interest in replacing subroutines that explicitly compute physical processes with approximate machine learning (ML) methods that are fast at inference time. Within weather and climate models, atmospheric radiative transfer (RT) calculations are especially expensive.  This has made them a popular target for neural network-based emulators. However, prior work is hard to compare due to the lack of a comprehensive dataset and standardized best practices for ML benchmarking. To fill this gap, we build a large dataset, ClimART, with more than **10 million** samples from present, pre-industrial, and future climate conditions, based on the Canadian Earth System Model.
ClimART poses several methodological challenges for the ML community, such as multiple out-of-distribution test sets, underlying domain physics, and a trade-off between accuracy and inference speed. We also present several novel baselines that indicate shortcomings of datasets and network architectures used in prior work.*

## Getting Started
<details><p>
    <summary><b> Requirements</b></summary>
    <p style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid red;">
    <ul>
    <li>Linux and Windows are supported, but we recommend Linux for performance and compatibility reasons.</li>
    <li>NVIDIA GPUs with at least 8 GB of memory and system with 12 GB RAM (More RAM is required if training with --load_train_into_mem option which allows for faster training). We have done all testing and development using NVIDIA V100 GPUs.</li> 
    <li>64-bit Python >=3.7 and PyTorch >=1.8.1. See [https://pytorch.org/](https://pytorch.org/) for PyTorch install instructions.</li> 
    <li>Python libraries mentioned in ``env.yml`` file, see Getting Started (Need to have miniconda/conda installed).</li> 
    </ul></p>
</details>

<details><p>
    <summary><b> Downloading the ClimART Dataset </b></summary>
    <p style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid red;">
    By default, only a subset of CLimART is downloaded.
    To download the train/val/test years you want, please change the loop in ``data_download.sh.`` appropriately.
    To download the whole ClimART dataset, you can simply run 
    
    bash scripts/download_climart_full.sh 
   </p>
</details>


    conda env create -f env.yml   # create new environment will all dependencies
    conda activate climart  # activate the environment called 'climart'
    bash data_download.sh  # download the dataset (or a subset of it, see above)
    # For one of {CNN, GraphNet, GCN, MLP}, run the model with its lowercase name with the following commmand:
    bash scripts/train_<model-name>.sh


## Dataset Structure

To avoid storage redundancy, we store one single input array for both pristine- and clear-sky conditions. The dimensions of ClimART’s input arrays are:
<ul>
<li>layers: (N, 49, D-lay) </li>
<li>levels: (N, 50, 4) </li>
<li>globals: (N, 82) </li>
</ul>

where N is the data dimension (i.e. the number of examples of a specific year, or, during training, of a batch),
 49 and 50 are the number of layers and levels in a column respectively. Dlay, 4, 82 is the number of features/channels for layers, levels, globals respectively. 

For pristine-sky Dlay = 14, while for clear-sky Dlay = 45, since it contains extra aerosol related variables. The array for pristine-sky conditions can be easily accessed by slicing the first 14 features out of the stored array, e.g.:
```      pristine_array = layers_array[:, :, : 14] ```

The complete list of variables in the dataset is as follows: </br>
